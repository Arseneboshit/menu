                        When a craving hits for those two all-beef patties it’s time to stop thinking about what’s on a
                        Big
                        Mac®
                        and take a bite. The McDonald's Big Mac is a 100% beef burger with a taste like no other. The
                        mouthwatering perfection starts with two 100% pure all beef patties and Big Mac Sauce sandwiched
                        between
                        a sesame seed bun. It’s topped off with pickles, crisp shredded lettuce, finely chopped onion
                        and a
                        slice of American cheese. It contains no artificial flavors, preservatives, or added colors from
                        artificial sources. Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip it if you like.
