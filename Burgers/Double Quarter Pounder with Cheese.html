                        Each Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese features two quarter pound* 100% fresh beef burger
                        patties that
                        are hot, deliciously juicy and cooked when you order. McDonald’s beef patties are seasoned with
                        just a
                        pinch of salt and pepper, sizzled on a flat iron grill, then topped with slivered onions, tangy
                        pickles
                        and two slices of melty cheese on a sesame seed bun. It contains no artificial flavors,
                        preservatives or
                        added colors from artificial sources.** Our pickle contains an artificial preservative, so skip
                        it if
                        you like.
